    "##### Performance\n",
    "Currently performance is somewhat tollerable at best. This is largely due to the high cost of generating all the random values required to initialise explosion particles and the general volume of vertex redraws required as particle numbers climb. These issues could be addressed thusly:\n",
    "1. Maintain a global vertices list and draw all particles in a single batch (rather than one by one)\n",
    "1. Creating and drawing pools of predetermined explosion particles/radii/colours rather than generating all random numbers on demand\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visual Quality\n",
    "There are a multitude of aesthetic features that could be added to the simulation. This includes particle effects (twinkles, colour transitions etc), different explosion shapes, multi-stage charges and most obviously, the third dimension! These would require *significantly* more effort, however only small modifications to the base class would be required, alongside the performance changes listed above."
