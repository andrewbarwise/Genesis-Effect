    "# Genesis Effect Simulation\n",
    "This is a simulation of the Genesis Effect using the particle system method described by William Reeves in his 1983 \n",

This paper outlines a particle system for simulating the Genesis effect in the film *Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan*. This application of particle systems was revolutionary, and represented a huge leap in computer graphics simulations.\n",

    "  - position, velocity and acceleration\n",

    "There are many improvements that can be made to the code. Here are some of them:\n",
    "1. Better rendering techniques and compositing. The use of a fragment shader, as well as improved camera movement and particle clipping would allow for a much more impressive result, includding techniques such as motion blur.\n",
    "1. The initial velocities and accelerations of the particles are framerate dependant. Altering the target framerate will change the overall motion of the simulation.\n",
    "1. Performance improvents can be made to the rendering of the sphere as well as the data structures and algorithms implemented. Experimentation regarding the performance boost, quality loss, and memory increase of moving away from random number generation in favour of a look up scheme could also be investigated."
